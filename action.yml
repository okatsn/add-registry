# Tag is required for it is able to be used.
# You should manually keep the major version (e.g., @v1) stick to the latest one of the v1.x.x series. For example:
# - I have a version released as v1.0.0 and tagged as v1.0.1: only `-uses: okatsn/add-registry@v1.0.0` works.
# - I add an additional tag (v1) to the same commit: both `@v1.0.0` and `@v1` works
# - I have a new version released as v1.0.1: `@v1` still points to v1.0.0
# - I delete the old v1 tag, and add a new one on the commit of v1.0.1: Now `@v1` points to the latest release v1.0.1
